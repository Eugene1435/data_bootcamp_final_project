### Project Description 

This project will study on how safe people are from motor collision in NYC from July 2012 to May 2019. Furthermore, this project will also give us insight of which Borough is the safest and which Borough is the most dangerous. In addition, by doing this project, we can know if Mayor Bill de Blasio did the right thing by creating Vision Zero in 2014. Vision Zero is a program that is suppose to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries in New York City by 2024. By using the data online, we can compare the changes in the numbers of deaths and injuries before and after 2014. We can also look at how Vision Zero improved throughout 2014 to 2019. Using the data on NYC Open Data, I will (i) compare and plot the number of people who are killed and injured from vehicle collisions across 5 different borough (ii) compare and plot the number of people who are killed and injured from 2012 to 2019. Compare how Vision Zero affect deaths and injuries (iii) explore the top 5 situations that cause accidents in NYC (iv) create a heatmap of 5 Borough and show the number of deaths and injuries.
